In a previous lesson, you saw a program that print's "Hello, World" to the console. 

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

`print` is used to log to the console. It's often helpful when you're debugging a Dart program.

```run-dartpad:theme-light:run-false:split-60
void main() {
    // change string to print whatever you'd like!
    print("Hello, World!");
}
```
